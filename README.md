# A barebones reference server in C

I find myself writing this server in C every few months. Each time
I have to scour the web for a good reference. Use this as a reference
to write your own bare server in C or other languages with a UNIX API
(Python, OCaml, etc).

# Run

```bash
make
bin/cserver
```
