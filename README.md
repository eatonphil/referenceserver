# A barebones UNIX reference server

I find myself writing this server in some language every few months.
Each time I have to scour the web for a good reference. Use this
as a reference to write your own bare server in C or other languages
with a UNIX API (Python, OCaml, etc).

# Run

```bash
make build-c
bin/cserver # go to localhost:15000

make build-ocaml
bin/ocamlserver # go to localhost:15000
```
